Discord.py was hard for me to learn - this is made to help others learn it better.

This will be turned into a youtube series on how to learn and use discord.py to make a discord bot. Any suggestions are welcome, feel free to make a PR or Issue with anything you think should be changed.

In the teaching folder in src, there are different main-{x}.py files, they start at one and new concepts are introduced with each one. They will go from simple to complex as new features and topics are added.
